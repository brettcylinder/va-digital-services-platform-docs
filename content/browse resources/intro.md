# Browsing Product Lifecycle Resources

No matter where you are in your product's lifecycle, these resources are here to help you work through challenges at each step, and infuse your decisions with user research.

## Generally the VA product life-cycle can be split into 4 phases:

But as you go, you may learn things that call for revisiting a previous phase - that's what iterative product development is all about!

1. [Discovering and validating assumed user and VA needs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-digital-services-platform-docs/blob/rr-edits/content/03-defining-the-project/00-project-introduction.md)
- Listen to business, technical stakeholders, and Veterans to really understand the problem area
- Define what "success" means in trackable metrics
- Map out potential solutions

2. [Designing and defining the user experience](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-digital-services-platform-docs/blob/rr-edits/content/04-design-process/00-design-process.md)
- Further flesh out solution ideas
- Test those solutions with all groups above
- Apply feedback gleaned
- Coordinate with content team and overall site architecture

3. [Staging and testing your application](/)
- Build the application
- Test some more with all groups above
- Bug find and fix
- Repeat 1 - 3 as needed until good enough to launch...

4. [Deploying and marketing your application to live users](/)
- Test in production with real users
- Deploy! And track the performance
- If all is going well, spread the word so Veterans can easiy find and use what you've built
