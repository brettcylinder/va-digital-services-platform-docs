# Designing the user experience

## Listening
Solving the problems people actually have, is critical to success. Projects often come out of someone’s passion to improve services. But that perspective can omit important factors. It's important to really poke at the edges of the idea to find trouble spots early in the process. Talking to the folks on the service side of the equation is
- Talk to people on both sides of the equation
  - From the business side:
    - What do you need to from Veterans to help them?
    - What are common errors you see people make that slow or threaten delivery of benefits?
      - What is working well?
    - What technical or policy issues are a challenge?
      - Are there work-arounds that might need to adjust with new approaches?
  - From the Veteran side:
    - What parts of the process are frustrating or painful?
    - What parts are working well?


## First pass
Once you think you’ve identified all the challenges, put a solution on the table. The faster this happens the better. It should feel complete, but don’t worry, you will probably find problems with this first pass. Doing it fast exposes these new facets of the problem early in the process. Keep talking to your stakeholders.

## Testing your ideas
Get prototypes in front of a representative sample of your audience and take notes. There is a ton of great writing on usability feedback sessions.
- This can be in person, or remote. We’ve gotten great feedback in both scenarios.
- Decide ahead of time what questions you are trying to answer and plan the conversation to expose those answers.
- Make sure you get your questions covered, but don’t be afraid to chase tangents. Sometimes they end up in interesting places

Get the whole team involved. Design, development, and copy folks all have their own perspective and will pick out different elements of the feedback. It also helps to socialize the feedback if more people had direct exposure. It is also usually really rewarding to hear Veteran voices talk about your work.

You are going to be tempted to immediately jump to solutions for problems that come up when Veterans use your prototype. Hold off until you’ve gotten all the feedback together and sifted through it.

## Applying feedback
After your feedback sessions it’s important to look at it as a whole, and as a group. You may need to weight different or conflicting feedback to decide on the way forward. Be mindful that sometimes even explicit feedback (this should look like that) can be addressed by fixing underlying problems. Analyze the feedback looking for underlying patterns.

## Coordination with other teams
### Content
Writing is as important as any other part of the design, and not all of it will be in your design. There are other parts of Vets.gov that may be impacted by what you are working on.
- What is your service called, is that Veteran language or VA language?
- What paths might Veterans be taking to get to your service, can they find it?
- Where would callouts to this new service might make sense?
- How will this impact overall site navigation?

## Repeat
You probably will not get it right the first time. Cycle through this process as many times as you need to, to get to a launchable state. But at the same time, there is nothing like being live to really test if it works. Balance the level of “done-ness” you need with the mission critical nature of your service.
