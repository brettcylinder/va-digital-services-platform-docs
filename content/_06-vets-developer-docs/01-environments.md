Vets-API and Vets-Website are automatically deployed to three shared environments. Additionally, the latest changes on all Pull Requests are automatically deployed to a [Review Instance](./development-workflow/#review-instances). Each of these deployments is connected with External Services within the VA to facilitate testing.

| ----------- | -------- | ------------ |
| development | dev-api.vets.gov | dev.vets.gov |
| staging | staging-api.vets.gov | staging.vets.gov |
