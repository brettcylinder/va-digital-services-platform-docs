### Development

#### Code repositories

The Veteran Tools Platform is broken into three parts:

1. <a title="Go to Vets-Website" href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website" target="_blank">Vets-Website</a>, which contains frontend applications and components users interact with

2. <a title="Go to Vets-API" href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api" target="_blank">Vets-API</a>, a JSON-based API used by the frontend to provide data to and from VA systems

3. <a title="Go to Vets-JSON-Schema" href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-json-schema" target="_blank">Vets-JSON-Schema</a>, which contains shared resources used to structure and validate form data between Vets-Website and Vets-API.


#### Internal Tools

To access metrics, build logs, deployment information and exception details, see the the [Internal Tools](./internal-tools-access) documentation.
