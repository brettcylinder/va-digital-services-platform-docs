title: Validating Your Hypothesis with User Research
label: Validating Hypotheses With Research
---
Talking with users provides invaluable insight into the obstacles they currently face and gives your team the opportunity to validate the accuracy of your solution hypothesis.

In order to get the most meaningful insights out of your conversations with users, we recommend going through a few steps:
1. [Figure out what you’re looking to learn](#figure-out-what-you-are-looking-to-learn)
2. [Create a conversation guide](#creating-a-conversation-guide)
3. [Recruit target users](#recruiting-target-users)
4. [Run research sessions](#running-research-sessions)
5. [Gathering findings and sharing with teammates](#gathering-findings-and-sharing-with-teammates)


## Figure out what you are looking to learn
This is a brainstorming session where your team should come up with questions that you are looking to understand. Here are some examples of questions that may come out of this exercise:
- Do Veterans understand the eligibility requirements for this VA benefit?
- What are the most difficult parts of this application process that users get stuck on?

Try using this [Planning template](/docs/resources/templates/planning-template) to drive the conversation during your brainstorming session.


## Creating a conversation guide
A conversation guide is used by a facilitator to organize a research or feedback session. It is a written guide, more speaker notes than a script, but a way to make sure all important questions get answered.
- Pre-plan questions to ask them without leading the participant to a desired outcome
- Prioritizes and sharpens questions.
- Provides consistency across sessions with different facilitators

## Recruiting target users
It’s important to hear from a representative sample of your constituency. Aim to talk to people across the full range of age, ethnicity, gender, geography, branches, service eras, and expertise that you’d expect to find in people using the tools you’re building. Consider recruiting participants in person at Veteran focused events, through VSO relationships, and even just using your personal networks via social media.

It is very helpful to have blurbs that are written with the various channels in mind. Short bites for social media, longer pieces for email. We have also made cards that we can hand out with contact details participants can use to ask about signing up for sessions.

Keep in mind that some communities can be more suspicious than others. A @va.gov email address or some personal vouching goes a long way. If you need any help recruiting, our team may be able to help you find users to interview. Please contact us at user_research@va.gov.


## Running research sessions
You need at least two people to run a research session. One person will facilitate the conversation and the other person is a designated note taker. This frees the facilitator up to concentrate on the conversation and follow it wherever it leads without trying to scribble notes along the way. Sessions can be 30 minutes or longer. More than 60 is not recommended. If meeting in person, ideally you can see the person where they typically perform the task you are investigating. But often times the sessions are virtual. We use video conferencing software that lets us share our screens with the participant.
- Reassure the participant that you are testing software, not them
- We don’t want to steer the participant, but being friendly is fine!
- We try not to schedule sessions back to back, everyone needs a break. More than a couple a day can be overwhelming.


## Gathering findings and sharing with teammates
Once the research sessions are done, it’s effective to meet as a group and sift through the notes to extract common themes. Consider behavior patterns, questions asked and note areas of frustration that users exhibit during their experience.

Synthesize the results of your user research sessions into a readout document to make it easier to communicate to people that weren’t there. A readout could be a written document, slide deck, or something else entirely, but it should be in a format that will be easy to use and share within your organization.
