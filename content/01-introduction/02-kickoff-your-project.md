You're ready to kickoff your new Vets.gov project!

Send an email to  _____@va.gov explaining your project idea in 2-3 sentences. Make sure to title the _Subject_ of your email like this: **Kickoff - [Fill in the Blank] Vets.gov Project**

We'll get back to you within one business day to set up a 15-20 min discussion between your team and a few members of the Vets.gov team. This conversation will just be to make sure we have a good understanding of what you're trying to achieve and how we can best help you. If you have any questions at this point in the process, this meeting is a great time to address those items and open up a line of communication!
