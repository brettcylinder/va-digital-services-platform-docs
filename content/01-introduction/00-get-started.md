# Welcome! Let's build some great apps together.

This Playbook is full of resources for teams across VA to build online applications that help Veterans get the services and benefits they deserve.

## To find the right place dive in, identify what you want to do:

### [Follow steps to create a product on Vets.gov](../launch-prep/steps-to-launch)
### [Get code for modern VA web components and design patterns](../components/detail/colors.html)
### [Browse resources on how to research, plan, design, and build great Veteran-facing tools](../defining-the-project/project-introduction)

It contains the steps, best practices, and governance necessary to launch VA applications with the support of the Digital Serviceâ€™s modern development infrastructure.

The documentation is broken into 4 stages of product development:
1. [Defining your project](../defining-the-project/project-introduction)
1. [Designing your user experience](../design-process/design-introduction)
1. [Developing your application](../development-process/getting-started)
1. [Launching your product on Vets.gov](../launch-prep/steps-to-launch)

These resources can also be mixed and matched to create VA products that don't get added to the Vets.gov domain. There are tools such as the [VA Design System] <span style="color:red">(NEEDS LINK)</span> and strategies for [conducting user research](../defining-the-project/validating-hypotheses-with-research)

Thanks for your interest in the Veteran-facing Tools Playbook and we can't wait to see what you create!
