The VA Veteran-facing Tools Playbook is a guide for teams across VA to quickly build online applications that help Veterans get the services and benefits they deserve. It contains the steps, best practices, and governance necessary to launch apps on Vets.gov with the support of the Digital Serviceâ€™s modern development infrastructure.

1. Let us know about your project
1. Discovery
1. [Defining your project](../defining-the-project/project-introduction)
1. [Designing your user experience](../design-process/design-introduction)
1. [Developing your application](../development-process/getting-started)
1. Review and test your product
1. [Deploy your product on Vets.gov](../launch-prep/steps-to-launch)

These resources can also be mixed and matched to create VA products that don't get added to the Vets.gov domain. There are tools such as the [VA Design System] <span style="color:red">(NEEDS LINK)</span> and strategies for [conducting user research](../defining-the-project/validating-hypotheses-with-research) that can be leveraged by your team.

Thanks for your interest in the Veteran-facing Tools Playbook and we can't wait to see what you create!
