title: Steps for Defining Your Project
label: Project Introduction
---

There are 4 main phases to any project - and it all starts with...

## Phase 1: Discovering and Defining the right solution
In this first phase, the goal is to connect directly with real potential users to validate your assumptions on what you *think* people will find valuable, what kind of product you *think* will solve their main problems.

Remember to stay open to having your hypotheses proven wrong. Changing approach at this phase is so much easier than after a product is live.

### Steps

[Set up a Product Outline](/docs/resources/templates/product-outline)
This is a living document that should become more robust as you learn more about uers and refine the product requirements. You can start at this phase by documenting your assumptions or hypotheses about user pain points, VA pain points, what you think users need, and what you think VA's goals are.

[Research your user and stakeholder needs](./understanding-user-needs)
Learn how to choose the research method that's right for your project, recruit users to talk to, draft up a research plan to capture the info you need, perform the research, and finally synthesize your findings. Update your Product Outline as you go!

[Write up epics and user storeis]
You should now be able to decide what small thing you want to design and test with users, to further validate whether you're on the right track. BUT! Before you start designing, you need to document out the details of the intended scope and feature boundaries. Epics and User Stories are common tools for doing just that.

## You can also skip head to read about the next phases:
- [Phase 2: Design the user experience](../design-process/design-process.html)
- [Phase 3: Develop your application](../development-process/getting-started.html)
- [Phase 4: Deploy and market your application to live users](../?)
