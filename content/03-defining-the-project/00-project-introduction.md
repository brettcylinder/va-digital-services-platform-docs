## Resources

- [Create a Product Outline](/): a living document that should become more robust as you learn more about uers and refine the product requirements. You can start at this phase by documenting your assumptions or hypotheses about user pain points, VA pain points, what you think users need, and what you think VA's goals are.
- [Document your Team Composition](/): this is a template with recommendations for what types of folks to include in which capacities to ensure your project has the appropriate implementation resources and validation resources.
- [Create a Product Charter](/): an alignment document whose purpose is to make sure your general solution approach is agreed upon by all stakeholders -- without going to deep into solution detail, since that will be further defined after Discovery. 
- [Choose a research method](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/): this is 18F's list of different Discovery methods. Browse to find a tactic that suits your projects needs, as well as instructions for how to perform that activity.
- [Recruit users](/): this is a guide for what kinds of channels and messaging to use when looking for Veterans, their family members, VSOs, or other potential users to talk to.
- [Draft a research plan](/): this is a guide for o make the most of your research sessions, you'll want to

- [Try out solution ideas](/):
- [Synthesize your findings](/): this is a Research Synthesis template for presenting your findings in a way that's relevant for  making product or feature decisions.
