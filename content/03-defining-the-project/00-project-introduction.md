title: Steps for Defining Your Project
label: Project Introduction
---

There are 4 main phases to any project - and it all starts with...

## Phase 1: Discovering and Defining the right solution
In this first phase, the goal is to connect directly with real potential users to validate your assumptions on what you *think* people will find valuable, what kind of product you *think* will solve their main problems.

Remember to stay open to having your hypotheses proven wrong. Changing approach at this phase is so much easier than after a product is live.

### Steps

[Set up a Product Outline](/docs/resources/templates/product-outline)
This is a living document that should become more robust as you learn more about uers and refine the product requirements. You can start at this phase by documenting your assumptions or hypotheses about user pain points, VA pain points, what you think users need, and what you think VA's goals are.

[Research your user and stakeholder needs](./understanding-user-needs)
Learn how to choose the research method that's right for your project, recruit users to talk to, draft up a research plan to capture the info you need, perform the research, and finally synthesize your findings. Update your Product Outline as you go!

[Review with POCs and Stakeholders](./)
You should now be able to decide what small thing you want to design and test with users, to further validate whether the product is on the right track. Find guidance here on how to document your approach, define your team, stakeholders, and POCs, write up a Charter, and check in with all parties for feedback/blessings before you get too far.

[Write up epics and user storeis](./)
Find templates for detailing out the product vision through epics and user stories so that design and development efforts can kick off with enough information.
