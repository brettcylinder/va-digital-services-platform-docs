title: Steps for Defining Your Project
label: Project Introduction

There are 4 main phases to any project - and it all starts with...

## Discovering user and business challenges and needs
In this first phase, the goal is to connect directly with real potential users to validate your assumptions on what you *think* people will find valuable, what kind of product you *think* will solve their main problems.

Remember to stay open to having your hypotheses proven wrong. Changing approach at this phase is so much easier than after a product is live.

### Resources

#### [Set up your Product documentation]
- Product Outline: (/docs/resources/templates/product-outline): This is a living document that should become more robust as you learn more about uers and refine the product requirements. You can start at this phase by documenting your assumptions or hypotheses about user pain points, VA pain points, what you think users need, and what you think VA's goals are.
- [Product Charter]: this is a document that will you align with stakeholders on the general approach, without getting into too much solution detail (since that will be further defined as you go). You can start filling it out

#### [Research your user and stakeholder needs](./understanding-user-needs)
- [Choose your research method(s)]: this is 18F's list of different Discovery methods. Browse to find a tactic that suits your projects needs, as well as instructions for how to perform that activity.
- [Recruit users](): this is a guide for what kinds of channels and messaging to use when looking for Veterans, their family members, VSOs, or other potential users to talk to.
- [Draft a research plan](): this is a guide for o make the most of your research sessions, you'll want to 
- [Synthesize your findings](): this is a Research Synthesis template for presenting your findings in a way that's relevant for  making product or feature decisions.

Remember to update your Product Outline as you go!

#### [Define team and get approval](./)

- [Document team composition]: this is a template with recommendations for what types of folks to include in which capacities to ensure your project has the appropriate implementation resources and validation resources.

Update your Product Outline, and the Charter if anything has changed in Discovery. Review these again with teammates to validate that there aren't concerns before you get too far.

#### [Write up epics and user stories](./)

Find templates for detailing out the product vision through epics and user stories, so that the design can be fully fleshed out with the appropriate scope.

- [Deploying and market your application to live users](../?)
